<h2>Finding other ways</h2>
<p>I discovered the art of programming and the R language in 2016. It took a while before I could get R &amp; Rstudio on my computer at work. Today, programming is my main occupation at work and I use R almost everyday. People I worked with and showed outputs from R scripts (Rmarkdown report, Shiny apps, Models) showed great interest and recognized it as a powerful and versatile tool. However, R did not crossed the production line yet: it is considered as research and development tool. It is used for quickly building prototypes and establish proofs of concepts.</p>
<p>Consequently, my team has little to no resources to get proper infrastructures like a dedicated server or even IT support. Still, we have a lot of collaborators without any R environment or even programming skills interested in what R made possible. For example: integrating a shiny application in a hotline service to help data-based decisions.</p>
<p>So, how to provide production-grade data product like a shiny app without a proper infrastructure ?</p>
<p>We had to find a way…</p>

<h2>How to replace a shiny server ?</h2>
<p>Without IT support and a majority non programmers users: impossible to install R on each computer and guide them through installing packages and runing the shiny app.
Thus the app needed to be portable, on a USB key for instance.</p>
