# Creating an Offline Golem

## Finding other ways

I discovered the art of programming and the R language in 2016. It took a while before I could get R & Rstudio on my computer at work. Today, programming is my main occupation at work and I use R almost everyday. People I worked with and showed outputs from R scripts (Rmarkdown report, Shiny apps, Models) showed great interest and recognized it as a powerful and versatile tool. However, R did not crossed the production line yet: it is considered as research and development tool. It is used for quickly building prototypes and establish proofs of concepts.

Consequently, my team has little to no resources to get proper infrastructures like a dedicated server or even IT support. Still, we have a lot of collaborators without any R environment or even programming skills interested in what R made possible. For example: integrating a shiny application in a hotline service to help data-based decisions.

So, how to provide production-grade data product like a shiny app without a proper infrastructure ?

We had to find a way...

## How to replace a shiny server ?

Without IT support and a majority non programmers users: impossible to install R on each computer and guide them through installing packages and runing the shiny app.
Thus the app needed to be portable, on a USB key for instance.
