<p>As first article on this R, datascience and dataviz dedicated blog, I present to you my entry for the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7nm6ed/battle_dataviz_battle_for_the_month_of_january/">DataViz battle of January 2018</a>. The rules can be found in the link.</p>

#this part was troublesome, I didn&#39;t figure that transpose would considerably easy the tidying process here.

<p>this dashboard was designed more for data exploration than knowledge presentation. To me, playing around with data is the best way to grasp it and to make first assumptions, this makes Tableau a powerful and fun tool for my first approach. Through that process, I could generate Hypothesis and even bring some real facts about this dataset.</p>
<p>As only 9 algaes can grow at 5C and 15C at 10C on a total of 19 species, temperature seems to be the most important factor for algae growth.
2. More light is not directly linked to more growth, instead, it looks like a genus or specy preference.")</p>
<div id="facts" class="section level3">
<h3>Facts</h3>
<p>Saying that I cannot control Light and Temperature and these variables vary from their minimum and maximum during the year, the best growing algae is <strong>Chlorella ellipsoidea</strong> as its mean growthrate is the highest.</p>

<h3>Visualisation</h3>
<p>Does temperature has a true effect on the algae of this dataset ? is Light really meaningless ? Let’s get back in R !</p>
<p>The strategy here is to model Temperature et Light effects over algae growth and perform statistical methods to draw approximate conclusions .</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#First, we plot the data points
box1 &lt;- ggplot(algae, aes(fct_inorder(as.factor(Temperature)), GrowthRate))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(group=Temperature), outlier.alpha = 0.4)+

  geom_boxplot(aes(group=Light), outlier.alpha = 0.4)+

<p>We see a global tendency of Growthrate increasing as Temperature increases. As for Light, nothing clear emerge from this representation.</p>
<p>Those two charts could be replaced by this other interesing visualisation.
Here, a <code>geom_signif</code> was added in order to compare Species through Light conditions as paired samples (linked by gray lines).Temperature effect is clear, higher temperatures generally mean faster growth. For Light, the result of the wilcoxon t.test for paired sample are not significant at any temperature, thus we cannot say that the algae population is different between the two light levels. However, a nice feature of this graph. allows us to see precisely how algae species behave from 2500 to 5000 lux : some grow faster at 2500 and others at 5000. (do these preferences change with temperature ?)</p>

<p>In order to assess and quantify the effect of Temperature and light on algae growth, we fit an anova model :</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fitanova &lt;- aov(algae$GrowthRate~algae$Temperature*algae$Light+algae$Light*algae$Temperature)
summary(fitanova) #this is also possible with lm() but doesn&#39;t accept factors</code></pre>
<pre><code>##                                Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)    
## algae$Temperature               1  5.301   5.301  58.742 2.25e-12 ***
## algae$Light                     1  0.001   0.001   0.006    0.940    
## algae$Temperature:algae$Light   1  0.047   0.047   0.516    0.474

<p>The results of this modelisation tell us that only temperature has significant effet on growth (or that we don’t have enough evidence to show Light effects if you prefer).</p>
<p>If we consider Temperature as continuous and fit into a linear model, we can provide a rough quantification of its effect on growth :</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fitlm &lt;- lm(algae$GrowthRate~algae$Temperature)

ggplot(algae, 
       aes(as.numeric(Temperature), GrowthRate))+
  geom_point(aes(color=Genus))+
  geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;)+
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom=&quot;line&quot;, aes(group=Genus, color=Genus))+
  labs(title =paste(&quot;Growthrate =&quot;,
                    signif(fitlm$coef[[2]], 3),
                    &quot;* Temperature +&quot;,
                    signif(fitlm$coef[[1]],3)), 
       subtitle=paste(&quot;Adj R2 = &quot;,
                      signif(summary(fitlm)$adj.r.squared, 5), 
                      &quot; p-value =&quot;,
                      signif(summary(fitlm)$coef[2,4], 5)))+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5), 
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  labs(x=&quot;Temperature (Celsius)&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>I am not rigorously sure about this assumption of effect quantification, so if i’m wrong please, contact me on twitter</p>
<p>So what doest Algae data set teach us ?
If you want to grow algae at industrial scale, you need to control water temperature and keep it at high level (at least around 30Celsius) while lack of sun is not a big problem.
So … that explains why the most part of algae industry in France was able to set up in Bretagne !</p>

<p>Although this chart is OK, it is far from finished, and I still spent about 2 hours to get it ! This is why I think combining R and Tableau is good for knowledge discovery process for a R padawan like me.</p>
